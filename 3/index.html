    <h1>Project 3: Face Morphing</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Defining Correspondences</h2>
    <p>
      I used `plt.ginput` to select corresponding points on both faces. In
      total, 30 corresponding points were selected -- 3 for each eye, 7 for the
      nose, 3 for the mouth, 3 for each ear, 3 for each brow, and 2 for the top
      and bottom of the head. I also automatically added the 4 corners of both
      images as corresponding points.

    <p>
      I then averaged the two sets of facial keypoints to get the average shape
      of Moe and Kanav. (This was an unweighted average i.e., the weights were
      each 0.5). I used the `Delaunay` function from scipy to compute a Delaunay
      triangulation from this average shape, and then I applied the Delaunay
      triangulation to the images of Moe and Kanav and their facial keypoints.

    <h2>Part 2: Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>
    <p>
      For each pair of corresponding triangles in the image of Moe and the
      midway image, I computed an affine transformation from the corners of the
      Moe triangle to the midway triangle. (Before computing this affine
      transformation, I converted the coordinates of the triangle corners to
      homogenous coordinates.) Once this affine transformation was computed, I
      used the inverse of the affine transformation to map pixels within the
      triangle in the midway image (computed using the `polygon` function) to
      pixels in Moe's image. I used a simple interpolation (rounding down these
      pixels in Moe's image to an integer) to extract the corresponding colors
      from Moe's image. By repeating for all pixels in each triangle and for all
      triangles, I was able to assemble Moe morphed into the midway geometry. I
      repeated this entire process for the image of Kanav as well.
    </p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Afterwards, I applied a cross-dissolve with the weights as 0.5 for both
      the morphed Moe and morphed Kanav images from above. This gave me the
      final midway face:

      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Part 3: The Morph Sequence</h2>
    <p>
      I generalized the previous logic for the midway face to allow for any
      `warp_frac` and `dissolve_frac` where `warp_frac` and `dissolve_frac` are
      parameters between 0 and 1 that control how much warping and
      cross-dissolving, respectively, is weighted to one image. (Computing the
      mid-way face involves a both `warp_frac` and `dissolve_frac` of 0.5.)
      Using this, I was then able to create a morph sequence of 45 frames where
      `warp_frac` and `dissolve_frac` go from 0 to 1 in 45 equally-spaced
      intervals (i.e., 0/44, 1/44, 2/44, ..., 43/44, 1).

    <h2>Part 4: The Mean Face of a Population</h2>
    <p>
      I chose the Danes dataset. Below is an example of a face from the Danes
      image, along with the corresponding keypoints. I averaged the keypoints
      across all faces, and below I also provide an example of the same face
      with the average keypoints. I repeated the process for both neutral
      expression and happy expression faces. (Note: for my analysis, I excluded
      the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Danish faces since they were in grayscale. This left
      me with 30 male and 7 female faces, each with neutral and happy expression
      images.)

    <p>
      Afterwards, I warped each face within the Danes dataset to the average
      geometry of the corresponding expression (neutral or happy). From these
      warped faces, I averaged them together to compute the average neutral or
      happy Danish face.

    <h2>Bells and Whistles</h2>
    <p>For my bells and whistles, I looked at improving the morphing algorithm by changing the rate of morphing (credit: Max on course staff for inspiration). Specifically, I looked at nonlinear functions to control how `warp_frac` and `dissolve_frac` change. I tried a sigmoid function to decrease the time spent in those awkward middle frames, and as comparison, tried a piecewise function that would instead increase the time spent in those awkward middle frames. </p>
